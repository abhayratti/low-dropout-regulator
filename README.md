# Low Dropout Regulator

As part of a summer project when I was learning about circuits and digital electronics, I worked on designing an LDO (low-dropout regulator) in Altium Designer.

## Project Status
- Calculations + map-out of necessary components (ICs, resistors, capacitors, diodes, connectors, headers) to create a dropout voltage of 3.3V âœ… 
- Circuit schematic âœ…
- Component sourcing from DigiKey âœ…
- Component footprint design based on datasheets (could have used DigiKey but wanted to learn) âœ…
- PCB footprint assembly ðŸŸ¡
